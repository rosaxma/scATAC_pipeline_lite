# A prefix or suffix to add to each barcode in the whitelist
# If the whitelist is reverse-complemented, this is done after reverse-complementation
# This is also dependent on the sequencing platform
# To find out, check if the observed barcodes are longer than the barcodes in the whitelist

# Aligner Settings
#######

# Aligner to use
# One of "chromap" or "bwt2"
# Chromap is significantly faster but is more memory-intensive

# We recommend keeping multi-mapping reads to improve discovery
# Default is 4

#######
# Fragment File Settings
#######

# Tn5 enzyme shift for the read coordinates of each fragment
# We recommend a +4/-4 shift, which is crucial for training ChromBPNet models
# This means that the + strand read pair start coordinate is increased by 4 bp
# And the - strand read pair start coordinate is decreased by 4 bp
# Note that this is different from the +4/-5 shift commonly seen in literature
tn5_shift_plus: 4
tn5_shift_minus: -4
